## Coding Standards

### Scala Code

- Follow the configured Scalafmt formatting rules
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add appropriate comments for complex logic
- Ensure all public methods have documentation
- Follow functional programming principles where appropriate

### Python Code

- Use Black for code formatting
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Add type hints where appropriate
- Include docstrings for functions and classes

### Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Include additional details in the body if necessary

Example:

```text
Add feature extraction pipeline for SMS text

- Implement tokenization with stop word removal
- Add TF-IDF vectorization with configurable features
- Include unit tests for text preprocessing
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if your changes affect the API or user interface
2. **Add tests** for new functionality
3. **Ensure all checks pass** (build, tests, linting)
4. **Request review** from maintainers
5. **Address feedback** promptly and professionally
